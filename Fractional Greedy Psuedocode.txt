    Fractional version of the knapsack problem: You can cut each item and take any fraction of it.
4.  For fractional version of the problem. Design an algorithm using greedy algorithm. 
    Pseudocode is needed if itâ€™s different from algorithm in 3. Will this algorithm achieve optimal solution?
