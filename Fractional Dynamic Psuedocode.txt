***
    Fractional version of the knapsack problem: You can cut each item and take any fraction of it.
2.  For fractional version of the problem. Design an algorithm using dynamic programming. 
    Pseudocode is needed if itâ€™s different from algorithm in 1. Will this algorithm achieve optimal solution?

    //The algorithm is the same as the 0-1 knapsack problem, except that we can take any fraction of an item.
