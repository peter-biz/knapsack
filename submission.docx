1. 0/1 Dynamic will achieve optimal solution some of the time, not all the time.
2. Fractional dynamic achieve optimal solution some of the time, not all the time. Gives same answer as 0/1 dynamic.
3. 0/1 Greedy will not achieve optimal solution most of the time.
4. Fractional Greedy will always achieve optimal solution.
